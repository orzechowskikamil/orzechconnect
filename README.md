It's Windows Phone 7 client of polish IM network called Gadu-Gadu (commonly known as GG or Dziadu-Dziadu).

It's written in C# and contains client itself, and library to handle GG 6.0 binary-xml protocol, both written by me. 

Don't be suprised by *shitty* quality of code - it was written in *2010 or 2011* year (I was on *II year of IT studies* during that time). It took 10 days and 14 nights to write this (yes, few times I coded for 36-40h without sleep :-))

It has some downloads right after release, but approx one year later Facebook become suddenly very popular in Poland, making GG useless and dead network. GG tries to threat authors of non-official clients with lawsuits. Shitty Windows Phone 7 API which didn't allow you to do anything interesting drove me crazy.

All of this facts convinced me to left project unmaintained quickly. It's put on Github for archival purposes.
